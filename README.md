# üóÉÔ∏è Test documentation

Here I would like to showcase test documentation I used for testing the webstore [Demoshopping.ru](https://demoshopping.ru/). All documentation is written in Russian language demonstrating my fluency in using it.

1. [Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-YO5gSBaxfIakPl1U3Bl-hCXl2MueUJP5IuauvX2_Fo/edit?gid=0#gid=0) - for testing the webstore by such modules as: "Registration", "Login" and "Product Catalog".
   
2. [Test case](https://github.com/LSalakhova/docs/blob/main/Test%20Cases%20for%20Registration,%20Authorization%20and%20Product%20Catalog.pdf) - 10 test cases for "Registration", "Authorization" and "Product Catalog", covering the main functions from the checklist.

3. As a result of the work with Test Cases on the QASE platform and previously created Checklists, several bugs were identified and reports were created on the Youtrack platform:
   
   * [Test run results](https://github.com/LSalakhova/docs/blob/main/Test%20run%20results%20via%20Qase.pdf) via QASE.

   * [Bug reports](https://github.com/LSalakhova/docs/blob/main/Bug%20reports%20via%20Youtrack.xlsx) via Youtrack.
